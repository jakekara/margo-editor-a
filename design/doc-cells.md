# doc cell feature

Child cells with a relationship label "documents" or "documents.{sub-label}" are documentation cells.

Some examples of useful sublabels might be

- api - API docs for the code block. This might be used with a document generator
- methods - High-level definition of the methodological approach that is readable by non-programmers
- caption - A caption for the code or cell output that would be suitable for publication purposes
